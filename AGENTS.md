# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for LLM agents working on this repository.

## Project Overview

A key-value storage engine built on LSM-tree architecture in Rust. Supports key-value separation via a value log (vLog) and MVCC-based concurrency control.

**Repository:** `ben1009/toy-kv-engine`

## Architecture

```

## Conventions

### Naming
- The main public type is `KvEngine` (renamed from `MiniLsm`)
- Use feature-phase names in comments (e.g., "compaction", "MVCC") not curriculum weeks
- Module-level docs should be concise, not circular

### Lint Policy
- Crate-level `#![allow(dead_code)]` and `#![allow(unused_variables)]` in `lib.rs`
- Starter code and stubs are expected; do not add per-module allows

### Testing
- All tests must pass: `cargo test --lib --tests`
- Format check: `cargo fmt --check`
- Lint check: `cargo clippy --all-features`
- Integration tests are in `kv-engine/src/tests/`
- vLog tests are in `kv-engine/src/vlog_integration_tests.rs`

### CI Requirements
All PRs must pass:
- `clippy`, `fmt`, `coverage`, `typos`
- `sanitizers` (address + leak sanitizer)
- `codecov/patch` and `codecov/project` (89% minimum)
- Cross-platform: `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-14`, `macos-latest`
- `dependency-review`

### Build Toolchain
- Rust nightly-2026-05-28 (pinned in CI)
- Edition 2024, resolver v3
- GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs

## PR Workflow

**Always use `--repo ben1009/toy-kv-engine` with every `gh` command.**

### Creating PRs
See `/home/liu/proj/agent-skills/pr-create/SKILL.md`

### Reviewing PRs
See `agent-skills/pr-review/SKILL.md`

Key rules:
1. **Never auto-fix without user confirmation**
2. **Never resolve a thread without replying first**
3. **Never merge with unresolved threads**
4. Reply to every review comment explaining what was fixed (or why not)
5. Resolve threads via GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation
6. Request re-review after addressing all comments

### Git Workflow
